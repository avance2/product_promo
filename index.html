				<p>After three years of work, Midnight Planétarium was unveiled at the annual Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie (SIHH), held every January in Geneva. The watch contains 396 separate parts and features the six closest planets accurately orbiting the sun.
					<br>Created by Van Cleef & Arpels in partnership with Christiaan van der Klaauw, Midnight Planétarium is an incredible timepiece that features six bejewelled planets in our solar system accurately rotating around our Sun.
				  <br>
		Each of the planets are represented by precious and semi-precious stones, ranging from red jasper to serpentine and turquoise. There is also a ‘lucky day’ feature that uses the bezel to allow owners to select any day of the year as your ‘lucky day’ and the Earth will fall underneath the painted star on the watch’s crystal on that day every year.
				<br>
					Before you rush out to buy one for your stargazing friend, make sure you can afford the staggering $245,000 price tag!

			<h2 class="">Daily wear</h2>
	<p class="">The water resistance of your watch is adapted to daily use that may involve exposure to small splashes of water. Nevertheless, we recommend that you do not immerse your watch in water. Always keep the crown and/or the push-piece in their initial positions, except when performing adjustments, and take care to change the joints regularly, to prevent any infiltration. 
 
We recommend avoiding exposure of your watch to extreme temperatures (less than 32°F; greater than 140°F) that risk damaging the joints or the bracelet or strap.

We advise you to protect your watch by keeping it away from intense magnetic sources (such as magnets or household appliances) that can have an impact on the proper functioning of the movement. 

We recommend avoiding exposure of your watch to cosmetic products or acidic or chemical substances.</p>	

</div>
			<div class="">
				<h2 class="">Cleaning and storing</h2>
	<p class=""> In general, we recommend that you clean your watch using a soft dry cloth, paying particular attention to the bracelet or strap. 
 
The bracelets and straps on Van Cleef & Arpels watches are made from noble materials including leather, gold and platinum. 
 
Leather is a material that ages naturally over time. To preserve it, we recommend avoiding all contact with water, humidity and cosmetic products.
 
Bracelets in gold and platinum may be cleaned using a soft brush soaked in warm water with PH neutral soap, rinsed in clear water and dried using a soft cloth. Be sure to hold the head of the watch out of the water during this manipulation. 
 
When you are not wearing your watch, we advise you to store it in its original case, to protect it from any impact and scratches.</p>	

</div>
				
			<div class="">	
				<h2 class="">Precautions for use</h2>
	<p class="">It is recommended that you avoid changing the time between 10PM and 2AM, as during this time the pinions in the movement are repositioned to automatically change the date. 
 
Quartz watches function using a battery that has an average life of 2 to 3 years, depending on the model. We recommend that you never leave a dead battery in your watch, as it could damage the movement. 
 
Watches with self-winding or manual-winding mechanical movements function using an oscillating weight. Ideally, you should wind your watch daily before wearing it. 
 
Self-winding watches wind naturally when they are worn.  To wind your watch correctly, we recommend that you start by adjusting the bracelet or strap precisely on your wrist. </p>
